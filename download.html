<h2>How to install HPP on your machine?</h2>

<p>
  The software architecture has been tested entirely on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and 14.04 LTS, respectively with ros-hydro and ros-indigo. Latest developpments are developped under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
  If you are running other distributions, we expect the library to work correctly but we can not guarantee it.
  Follow the instructions <a href="https://github.com/humanoid-path-planner/hpp-doc#readme">here</a>.
